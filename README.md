# NEUR30006-final-project-Nov.2022-semester2
All MNIST dataset created and used for this project can be found here.

The MNIST traning data is too large, thus cannot be upload here.

The original MNIST traning dataset is used from https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv

The new MNIST traning dataset for random rotation angles can be created according to code in NEUR30006-final-project_1038588.ipynb

Improvement on project.ipynb includes one method of how to make new image with multiple MNIST digits for object detection and localization tasks.
